# regfr_iii_segmentation
Kraken segmentation model for 15th century imperial charters

## Description
A Kraken segmentation modell (regions and baselines) for charters issued by the Roman Chancery under Frederik III (1440-1493).
This model was trained using data produced by the research office of the [Regesta Imperii - Regesten Kaiser Friedrichs III.](https://ri.bbaw.de/de) with the [ubma_segmentation](https://github.com/JKamlah/ubma-segmentation-ocr-model) model as base.
The model was finetuned over 100 epochs with standard parameters within eScriptorium and reached an accuracy level of 70.7% in training.

This model was prepared in the ongoing HTR project of the Regesta Imperii-Regesten kaiser Friedrichs III., [Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities(BBAW)](https://www.bbaw.de) and trained by Frederik Skidzun (BBAW, [ORCiD 0009-0002-7712-4207](https://orcid.org/0009-0002-7712-4207))
